KLER: Your Smart, Sustainable Closet

Kler is a personal project I've been building to solve a problem I’ve had for years: keeping track of what I own, what I actually wear, and how often things just sit in the back of my closet collecting dust. The idea is to give users a clean, simple way to log clothing items, organize them into categories, and visualize their usage habits all in one place.
I’m still actively developing the app, adding features, fixing bugs, and figuring out what the “final” version might look like. This repo is a mix of everything I have learned in my Boston College Introduciton to Swift class and a little more. 

What the App Does (so far)

- Add clothing items with a name, color, notes, last-worn date, and a photo from your library
- Organize items into categories (like Tops, Shoes, Coats, etc.) with clean album-style navigation
- Track usage using a “Last Worn” date and future analytics views
- Store items locally using SwiftData with Firebase integration
- Works on real devices


Current Challenges / TODOs

- Introducing Firebase storage
- Adding analytics (wear count, cost-per-wear, donation suggestions)
- Supporting cloud sync
- Improving the UI for categories and photo handling
